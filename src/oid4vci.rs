//! An API for the issuance of Verifiable Credentials based on the
//! [OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance] specification.
//!
//! # [OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance]
//!
//! This library implements an OAuth protected API for the issuance of
//! Verifiable Credentials as specified by [OpenID for Verifiable Credential
//! Issuance].
//!
//! Verifiable Credentials are similar to identity assertions, like ID Tokens in
//! [OpenID Connect], in that they allow a Credential Issuer to assert End-User
//! claims. A Verifiable Credential follows a pre-defined schema (the Credential
//! type) and MAY be bound to a certain holder, e.g., through Cryptographic
//! Holder Binding. Verifiable Credentials can be securely presented for the
//! End-User to the RP, without involvement of the Credential Issuer.
//!
//! Access to this API is authorized using OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749],
//! i.e., Wallets use OAuth 2.0 to obtain authorization to receive Verifiable
//! Credentials. This way the issuance process can benefit from the proven
//! security, simplicity, and flexibility of OAuth 2.0, use existing OAuth 2.0
//! deployments, and [OpenID Connect] OPs can be extended to become Credential
//! Issuers.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! **Endpoints**
//!
//! The library is architected around the [OpenID4VCI] endpoints, each with its
//! own `XxxRequest` and `XxxResponse` types. The types serialize to and from
//! JSON, in accordance with the specification.
//!
//! The endpoints are designed to be used with Rust-based HTTP servers, such as
//! [axum](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/).
//!
//! Endpoints can be combined to implement both the [OpenID4VCI] Authorization
//! Code Stage and Pre-Authorized Code Stage.
//!
//! **Running**
//!
//! Per the OAuth 2.0 specification, endpoints are exposed using HTTP. The
//! library will work with most common Rust HTTP servers with a few lines of
//! 'wrapper' code for each endpoint.
//!
//! In addition, implementors need to implement 'Provider' traits that are
//! responsible for handling externals such as  storage, authorization, external
//! communication, etc.. See [`core_utils`](https://docs.rs/core-utils/latest/core_utils/).
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! The following example demonstrates how a single endpoint might be surfaced.
//!
//! A number of elements have been excluded for brevity. A more complete example
//! can be found in the `examples` directory.
//!  
//! ```rust,ignore
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() {
//!     // `Provider` implements the `Provider` traits
//!     let endpoint = Arc::new(Endpoint::new(Provider::new()));
//!
//!     let router = Router::new()
//!         // --- other routes ---
//!         .route("/credential", post(credential))
//!         // --- other routes ---
//!         .with_state(endpoint);
//!
//!     let listener = TcpListener::bind("0.0.0.0:8080").await.expect("should bind");
//!     axum::serve(listener, router).await.expect("server should run");
//! }
//!
//! // Credential endpoint
//! async fn credential(
//!     State(endpoint): State<Arc<Endpoint<Provider>>>, TypedHeader(host): TypedHeader<Host>,
//!     TypedHeader(auth): TypedHeader<Authorization<Bearer>>,
//!     Json(mut req): Json<CredentialRequest>,
//! ) -> AxResult<CredentialResponse> {
//!     // set credential issuer and access token from HTTP header
//!     req.credential_issuer = format!("http://{}", host);
//!     req.access_token = auth.token().to_string();
//!
//!     // call endpoint
//!     endpoint.credential(req).await.into()
//! }
//! ```
