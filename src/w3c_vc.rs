//! # Verifiable Credentials
//!
//! This module encompasses the family of W3C Recommendations for Verifiable
//! Credentials, as outlined below.
//!
//! The recommendations provide a mechanism to express credentials on the Web in
//! a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and
//! machine-verifiable.

// TODO: move this macro to a more appropriate location (its own crate perhaps).
// N.B. the current dependency tree is a little complex, so this is a temporary
// solution that avoids cyclic dependencies.

/// Generate a closure to resolve public key material required by `Jws::decode`.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use credibil_infosec::{verify_key, KeyOps};
///
/// let resolver = KeyOps::resolver(&provider, &request.credential_issuer)?;
/// let jwt = jws::decode(proof_jwt, verify_key!(resolver)).await?;
/// ...
/// ```
