# Contributing

We're excited to work on Vercre and hope you will be too! This guide should help you get
up and running with Vercre development. But first, make sure you've read our 
[Code of Conduct](./coc.md).

Vercre is ambitious, with much work to be done to achieve full compliance with the core
OpenID specifications. And while we're confident we can achieve our goals, we see many 
opportunities for others to get involved and help get there more quickly.


## Join Our Chat

We chat about Vercre development on [Zulip](https://vercre.zulipchat.com/) — join us!.

If you're having trouble building Vercre, aren't sure why a test is failing, or have any
other questions, feel free to ask on Zulip. Not everything we hope to do with these projects 
is reflected in the code or documentation yet, so if you see things that seem missing or
that don't make sense, or even that just don't work the way you expect them to, we're also 
interested to hear about that!

As always, you're more than welcome to open an issue too!

Finally, we have bi-weekly project meetings, hosted on Zoom, for Vercre. For more
information, see our meetings agendas/minutes repository. Please feel free to contact us
via Zulip if you're interested in joining!

## Finding Something to Hack On

If you're looking for something to do, these are great places to start:

Issues labeled "good first issue" — these issues tend to be simple, what needs to be
done is well known, and are good for new contributors to tackle. The goal is to learn 
Vercre's development workflow and make sure that you can build and test Vercre.

Issues labeled "help wanted" — these are issues that we need a little help with!

If you're unsure if an issue is a good fit for you or not, feel free to ask in a comment
on the issue, or in chat.

## Mentoring

We're happy to mentor people, whether you're learning Rust, learning about Verifiable 
Credentials, Credential wallets or anything else that piques your interest.

We categorize issues in the issue tracker using a tag scheme inspired by Rust's issue tags. 
For example, the E-easy marks good beginner issues, and E-rust marks issues which likely 
require some familiarity with Rust, though not necessarily Verifiable Credentials.

Also, we encourage people to just look around and find things they're interested in.
This a good time to get involved, as there aren't a lot of things set in stone yet.
